# TODO

## Limit of 10 Lucky Names per Day

- Implement a daily limit of 10 lucky names.
- Track the number of winners added each day.
- Once the limit is reached, display a message to the user indicating that the daily limit has been reached.

## Advance to the Next Day

- Add a button or mechanism to advance to the next day.
- Reset the daily count of lucky names when advancing to the next day.
- Ensure that names from the previous day are not repeated in the next day's list of lucky names.

## Further Improvements

### Authentication

- Implement user authentication to ensure only authorized users can access or modify the list of winners.
- Use a secure method such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for managing user sessions.

### Rate Limiting and Error Handling

- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.
- Improve error handling to gracefully manage API unavailability or other errors.
- Implement retry strategies for API calls that fail due to transient issues.

### Deployment

- Deploy the application to a cloud environment such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
- Use CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment process.
- Ensure the application is running with the latest version of the code.

### Code Quality

- Set up tools to measure and enforce code quality, such as ESLint and Prettier.
- Apply linting rules and format the code according to preferred guidelines.

### Accessibility

- Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities.
- Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and providing alternative text for images.

### CSS Structure

- Structure CSS to maximize reusability and minimize leakage between components.
- Use a CSS preprocessor like SCSS or a CSS-in-JS solution for better maintainability.

### Additional Improvements

- Add unit tests and integration tests to ensure the application's reliability.
- Optimize performance by lazy loading components and using efficient data fetching techniques.
- Collect user feedback and iterate on the application's design and functionality.
